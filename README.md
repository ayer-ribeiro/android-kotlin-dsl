# Kotlin DSL Gradle Configuration Example

This repository serves as a didactic example showcasing the usage of [Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) for organizing Gradle configuration.

The architectural setup has been crafted based on the Hello World code automatically generated by Android Studio. Consequently, it might seem unnecessarily complex for demonstration purposes. However, it stands as a helpful resource to understand the diverse possibilities of utilizing this tool.

## Considerations

It's important to take into account the drawbacks of the proposed structure:

- **Negative Impact on Learning Curve:** This setup might present challenges for developers at the outset of their careers.
- **Non-functional Version Check Lint:** The lint check for versions may not function as intended.
- **Compilation Time:** It's worth noting that compilation time might be longer when using Kotlin Script (KTS) compared to Groovy. For more information, refer to [Compilation Time Issues](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/migrate-to-kts#known_issues) (Accessed on 19/09/2022).
